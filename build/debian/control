Description: terminal status monitor for tor
 Nyx, f/k/a the anonymizing relay monitor (arm), is a terminal status monitor
 for Tor relays, intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and
 anyone stuck with a tty terminal. This works much like top does for system
 usage, providing real time statistics for:
 .
  - bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage
  - relay's current configuration
  - logged events
  - connection details (ip, hostname, fingerprint, and consensus data)
  - etc.
 .
